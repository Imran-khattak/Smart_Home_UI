## Smart Home UI

## Getting Started
A home electric devices control application is a software solution that allows you to remotely manage and control various electrical devices in your home from a single, centralized platform. This application typically includes features such as lighting control, temperature regulation, energy monitoring, security management, and more. With the help of this application, you can monitor and adjust the settings of your devices from anywhere, anytime, and with just a few taps on your smartphone or tablet. Whether you're at home or away, you have complete control over your home's electrical systems, which can help improve comfort, security, and energy efficiency.
